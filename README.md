需要手动修改 Cocos2d-x 3.0 中 cocos2d/cocos/platform/android/javaactivity.cpp 
//jint JNI_OnLoad(JavaVM *vm, void *reserved)

This is an experimental project from Cocos2d-x, featuring 3D models in a 2d game.

Using Cocos2d-x 3.0 and the experimental Sprite3D.

###Sprite3D


The Sprite3D code featured in this project can currently load static OBJ model.

to load a model:
```c++
auto model = Sprite3D::create("3dmodel.obj", "texture.png");
```

###Toon Shading

There is no lighting in Cocos2d-x yet. But
To compliment that, we added built-in support for toon-shader, specifically, toon outline:
```c++
auto model = Sprite3D::create("3dmodel.obj", "texture.png");
model->setOutline(1.5, Color3B(0,0,0)); // set the outline to be 1.5 point wide, and black
```


###3D API

3D API are available since Cocos2d-x 3.0 for all Nodes

```c++
node->setPosition3D(Vertex3F(x,y,z));
Vertex3F pos = node->getPosition3D();

node->setRotation3D(Vertex3F(x,y,z));
Vertex3F rot = node->getRotation3D(); //2d rotation is the same as rotating in z axis
```
3D API are also ported to some actions as well
```c++
node->runAction(RotateBy::create(Vertex3F(x,y,z)));
```
